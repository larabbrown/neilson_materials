# Stones of Neilson Library

This repository contains code used to generate linestrings depicting routes from nine different quarries and manufacturing sites to Neilson Library at Smith College. These routes were used in a StoryMap created for GEO/ENV 150 in the Spring 2021 semester.

In an idealistic attempt at reproducability in ArcGIS Pro, I've included my methodology in the [methods.md](methods.md) file. 

The web map created from this data can be viewed [here](https://smithcollege.maps.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?webmap=d2d610b9fb9f458288b22b5de09f64d3). Story map is forthcoming!
